#  NFL Investigates Claims of Illegal Gambling among its Players

The NFL has announced that it is investigating allegations of illegal gambling among its players. Commissioner Roger Goodell stated that the league takes any allegations of this nature very seriously and will fully investigate any claims made.

This news comes just a few weeks after three-time Super Bowl champion and current free agent, Tom Brady, was suspended four games for his involvement in the "Deflategate" scandal. That scandal arose from accusations that Brady had conspired with team employees to illegally alter the air pressure in footballs used in the AFC Championship Game.

While the NFL has not released any specific details about the latest gambling allegations, it is believed that they involve players betting on games both against and for their own teams. This would be a direct violation of NFL rules which state that players are not allowed to gamble on any aspect of the game.

Any player found guilty of violating these rules could face significant punishment, including a ban from the league. It is unclear at this point whether or not any players have been implicated in the allegations, but it is likely that more information will be forthcoming in the coming weeks.

#  Commissioner Roger Goodell Addresses Allegations of Widespread Gambling in NFL

In a letter sent to all 32 NFL teams this morning, Commissioner Roger Goodell addressed allegations of widespread gambling in the NFL. The letter reads, in part:

"The integrity of our game is of paramount importance to me, and I know it is to you as well. We will not tolerate conduct that undermines the integrity of our sport. The allegations leveled against some players this week are troubling. We are steadfast in our commitment to protect the integrity of the NFL and investigate any potential violations."

Goodell announced that the league is initiating an investigation into allegations of widespread gambling in the NFL. "We have been monitoring the situation closely and are coordinating with the appropriate law enforcement authorities," he said. "This will be a thorough and comprehensive investigation, and we will take appropriate action based on what we find."

Goodell also said that any players found to have violated the league's gambling policies will be subject to discipline, including suspension or expulsion from the NFL. "Gambling on NFL games is a violation of our rules and a serious offense," he said. "We have a strong policy against it and we will take appropriate action against anyone who violates it."

#  Ravens QB Joe Flacco Admits to Betting on NFL Games

In a shocking admission, Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco has admitted to betting on NFL games.

"I'm not going to sit here and deny that I've bet on NFL games before," said Flacco in a press conference Wednesday. "I'm not proud of it, but I have done it."

Flacco said that he typically bets on either the Ravens or the opposing team, depending on who he thinks is going to win. He also insists that he has never tried to fix a game and always bets with his own money.

"I've never made any arrangements with anyone else involved in the game to try and make sure that it goes a certain way," said Flacco. "I'm just a guy who likes to bet on football."

NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has yet to comment on Flacco's admission, but it is likely that the Ravens QB will face some sort of punishment from the league.

#  Giants' Odell Beckham Jr. Fined for Illegal Sports Gambling

Odell Beckham Jr. the wide receiver for the New York Giants was fined $12,000 by the NFL for placing illegal sports bets.

Beckham Jr. admitted to placing two wagers on games last season and apologized for his actions in a statement issued Wednesday.

"I apologize for my actions and I understand the severity of this matter," Beckham Jr. said. "I am sorry that I disappoint my fans, coaches, teammates and the entire New York Giants organization."

NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said that Beckham Jr. violated league policy prohibiting players from gambling on NFL games. The policy also prohibits players from associating with any person who is engaged in legal or illegal gambling.

The Giants released a statement supporting their player and saying they are disappointed in his actions but will stand by him.

This is not Beckham Jr.'s first run-in with the law. He has been fined by the NFL for a number of other incidents, including punching a hole in the wall of Lambeau Field after a playoff loss to the Packers and drawing an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for taking his helmet off prematurely after scoring a touchdown against Washington.

#  Philadelphia Eagles' Nigel Bradham Suspended for Violation of NFL's Gambling Policy

The suspension will take effect immediately, and Bradham will miss the Eagles' Week 2 matchup against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Bradhamviolated a rule prohibiting players from betting on any NFL game, and he will be reinstated in Week 3.

"I want to apologize to my teammates, coaches and Eagles fans for this mistake," Bradham said in a statement. "I made a bad decision and I accept full responsibility for my actions."

Bradham is one of the team's leading tacklers, recording 76 tackles last season. He started all 16 games for the Eagles and will be missed against the Buccaneers.

 PhiladelphiaEagles Coach Doug Pederson said he was disappointed in Bradham's decision but that the team would move on.

"It's something that we're obviously not happy about," Pederson said Friday. "He knows that, and he's going to learn from it and we'll move on."
