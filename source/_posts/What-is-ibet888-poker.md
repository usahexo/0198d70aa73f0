#  What is ibet888 poker?

Ibet888 poker is one of the most popular online poker games in the world. It is a type of card game that involves betting and bluffing. The objective of the game is to make the best five-card hand possible using any combination of the seven cards available to each player.

# How to Play ibet888 Poker

To begin, all players must ante up a small bet. This gets the action started and also serves as a safeguard against anyone who might try to simply sit out without paying. After that, players are dealt two cards face down and one card face up. The player with the highest face up card begins the first betting round.

In subsequent rounds, the player who has the best hand (according to traditional poker rankings) begins the betting. If there is a tie for best hand, then the player who was first to bet in that particular round starts the action. Play then proceeds clockwise around the table until all players have either folded or put in another bet that is at least as high as the previous bet.

Players can either choose to fold (give up their cards and lose whatever they have already bet) or put in another bet that is at least equal to the previous one. Once all players have either folded or put in a higher bet, then new cards are dealt face up to each player remaining in the hand, including the person who started the final betting round. This allows everyone’s chances to improve (or not).

After all players receive their fourth card, a second betting round takes place, just like the first. Following that, a fifth and final card is dealt face up to each player and a third and final betting round takes place. The best five-card poker hand takes home the pot!
