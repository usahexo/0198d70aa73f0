#  How to Add Blackjack to Your Online Casino 

Are you looking to add blackjack to your online casino? Whether you’re a seasoned pro or new to the game, this guide will help get you up and running in no time.

To start, you’ll need to find a blackjack game provider. There are many to choose from, but we recommend BetOnline for their selection of games, user-friendly interface and reliable customer service.

Once you’ve registered for an account and chosen your game, it’s time to start playing. The basic rules of blackjack are simple: draw cards until your total reaches 21 or as close as possible without going over (a “bust”), and beat the dealer's total without going over 21.

The best way to improve your chances of winning is to learn the different types of hands and how they rank. In blackjack, there are two main categories of hands: pairs and non-pairs. A pair consists of two cards of the same rank, such as two kings or two aces. A non-pair is any hand that doesn't consist of a pair. Here are the rankings of each type of hand:

Pair 
A pair is any two cards of the same rank. The rank of the pair determines the value of the hand. For example, two sixes (6 + 6 = 12) would be a 12, while two twos (2 + 2 = 4) would be a four.
Sixes are higher than twos, so the 12 would beat the 4. 

Non-pair 
A non-pair is any hand that doesn't consist of a pair. The rank of each card in the hand determines its value. For example, an Ace (1) and a three (3) would be a three because the Ace is ranked highest followed by face cards (10 through King), then number cards from two through nine. An Ace and a six (1 + 6 = 7) would be a seven because the Ace is ranked highest followed by number cards from two through nine (2 through 9).

Ace 
An Ace can have one of two values: 1 or 11. When an Ace is counted as 1, it's called a "hard" Ace because it can't be counted as 11 without resulting in a bust (e.g., if an Ace is drawn with another card totalling six [5 + 1 = 6], it would be counted as hard Ace). When an Ace is counted as 11, it's called a "soft" Ace because it can still be counted as 1 if necessary without resulting in a bust (e.g., if an Ace is drawn with another card totalling five [4 + 1 = 5], it would be counted as soft Ace). In general, it's better to keep a soft Ace rather than risk losing by trying to draw another card to make it hard.[2] 

Two 
Two can have one of two values: 2 or 10. When Two is counted as 2, it's considered high because it's next highest after an Ace (11). When Two is counted as 10, it's considered low because it's one less than an ace (11 - 10 = 1). 

Three 
Three can have one of three values: 3, 10 or 20. When Three is counted as 3, it's considered high because it's next highest after Two (10). When Three is counted as 10, it's considered low because its next lowest after Two (10 - 2 = 8). When Three is counted as 20, don't worry about what its value actually is -- just remember that Twenty beats all other hands.[3] 

Four 
Four can have one of four values: 4, 10, 14 or 20.. When Four is counted as 4s its low; when Four countsdas 10s its high; when Four countsdas 14s its medium; when Four countsdas 20s its ace high..

Five 
Five can have one of five values: 5, 10 15 or 25..When Five is coundudasa 5 its low medium; when Five countduasa 10 its high; when Five counudasa 15 its medium; when Five countduasa 25 ace high

#  How to Add Other Gambling Games to Your Online Casino

When you first open your online casino, you may be surprised at just how many different games are available to play. However, even if your casino offers all the games you could ever want, you may find that there are still some gaps in its library. If this is the case, don't worry - there are plenty of other gambling games out there that you can add to your casino to make it even more exciting. In this article, we'll take a look at four of the best ones.

1. Keno

Keno is a classic casino game that is perfect for players who like to bet on big jackpots. The basic premise of the game is simple - you select a set of numbers and then watch as they are randomly drawn one by one. The player who matches the most numbers wins the jackpot. While keno may not be as popular as blackjack or roulette, it's still a lot of fun to play and can be very lucrative if you're lucky.

2. Bingo

If you're looking for a social gambling game that everyone can enjoy, bingo is the perfect choice. The basic premise of the game is to match numbers on your card with those that are called out by the dealer. The first person to cover all of their numbers wins the round (and often some pretty impressive prizes). Not only is bingo great fun, but it's also one of the easiest games to learn how to play.

3. Craps

Craps may be one of the more complicated gambling games out there, but it's also one of the most exciting. This game involves betting on dice rolls, with some pretty high stakes possible if you get lucky. While craps can seem intimidating at first, with a little practice you'll be able to make smart bets and increase your chances of winning big bucks.

4. Slots

Last but not least, slots are always a popular choice for online casino players. These games are easy to play and offer up plenty of excitement and rewards, making them ideal for casual gamers and high rollers alike. Whether you're looking for traditional three-reel slots or modern video slots with movie-style graphics and bonus rounds, there's something for everyone when it comes to slots gaming.
