#  Player Claims To Have Won Pot Over Spread Buffet Controversy In Horseshoe Monster Bingo

A pot worth over $4000 was won this past weekend by a player at Horseshoe Monster Bingo. According to the player, the pot was won during a heated debate over the legitimacy of a buffet spread offered at the casino.

The buffet in question is alleged to be in violation of state law due to its excessive offerings. The controversy began on Friday night when players started to take note of the extensive spread that was being offered for free at the casino.

Players noted that there were dozens of options for food, including everything from pizza to lobster. Some players claimed that it was impossible to win any significant amount of money on the bingo games while other players said that they would take advantage of the free food.

The argument intensified on Saturday night when one player allegedly hit a $4000 jackpot while another player was taking their final bite of a piece of pizza. The winning player immediately claimed that the pot was won as a result of the competitive buffet atmosphere and not due to any skill on their part.

Casino officials have yet to issue a statement on the matter but it is likely that they will investigate whether or not the buffet truly is in violation of state law. In the meantime, it appears that the winner of the $4000 pot will be allowed to keep their winnings.
