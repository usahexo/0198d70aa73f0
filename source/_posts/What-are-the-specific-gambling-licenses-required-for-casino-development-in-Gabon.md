#  What are the specific gambling licenses required for casino development in Gabon?

The first step in casino development in Gabon is obtaining the required gambling licenses. The licenses are issued by the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Cooperation (MINEPIC) and are valid for a period of five years. There are four types of licenses:

The cost and requirements for each type of license vary, so it is important to do your research before applying. For example, the minimum capital requirement for a casino license is $10 million, while the minimum capital requirement for a gaming machine license is only $5,000.
