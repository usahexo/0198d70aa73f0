# Find Out Which Casino Games Were Popular In Ancient China!

Ancient China is a very mysterious place with a lot of unanswered questions. What we do know, however, is that the people in this era were incredibly innovative and loved gambling! In fact, ancient Chinese casino games are still played today and are incredibly popular. If you’re interested in trying your luck at some of these games, make sure to read on for a brief introduction to each one.

#1: Fan Tan

Fan Tan is a simple game that can be played with any number of players. One player is designated as the banker and all other players are given some number of chips. The banker then deals four cards face down to each player and one card face up to themselves. The face up card is then used as the first pick for all players. The goal of the game is to get rid of all of your chips by picking cards that add up to either 10 or 1 (e.g., 4 + 6). The first player to run out of chips automatically loses the game.

#2: Pai Gow Poker

Pai Gow Poker is a variation of traditional poker that uses special tiles instead of playing cards. Each player is dealt seven tiles and must create two hands using five tiles each – one hand should be composed of low-value tiles while the other should be composed of high-value tiles. The goal of the game is to beat both your opponent’s hands using whatever combination of tiles you choose. If you manage to do so, you win!

#3: Mahjong

Mahjong is a tile-based game that is thought to have originated in China sometime in the 1800s. The game consists of 136 tiles that are divided into four different suits (bamboo, dots, characters, and winds). Players take turns drawing and discarding tiles until they can form a set of three or four matching tiles and declare mahjong. The winner is the first player to discard all their tiles or the player with the most points at the end of the game.

#4: Sic Bo

Sic Bo is an ancient Chinese dice game that is still popular today. The game involves three dice which are shaken in a cup before being rolled onto a table.Players bet on what combination of numbers will come up on the dice – similar to betting on roulette outcomes.
