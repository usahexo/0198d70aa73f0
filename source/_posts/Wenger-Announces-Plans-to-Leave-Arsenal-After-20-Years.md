#  Wenger Announces Plans to Leave Arsenal After 20 Years

Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger announced today that he will leave the club at the end of the season after 22 years in charge.

"After careful consideration and following discussions with the club, I feel it is the right time for me to step down at the end of the season," Wenger said in a statement on the club's website. "I am grateful for having had the privilege to serve the club for so many memorable years. I managed the club with full commitment and integrity."

Wenger, 68, has been a controversial figure at Arsenal in recent years, with some fans calling for him to be replaced. The Gunners have not won a Premier League title since 2004 and fell short this season, finishing in sixth place.

Wenger is one of only three managers to have taken charge of more than 1,000 games in England's top division, and his departure will mark the end of an era at Arsenal.

#  Sanchez Scores Winner in Last Minute as Arsenal Beat Manchester United

With the game seemingly heading for a draw, Sanchez popped up in the last minute to fire home the winner and give Arsenal all three points.

The goal was a typical Sanchez strike, as he latched onto a loose ball inside the box before firing it past David de Gea into the top corner.

Arsenal started the game brightly and had several chances to take an early lead, but they were unable to make the most of their dominance and Manchester United came into the game more as it went on.

The away side had their best chance of the first half in the last minute when Anthony Martial was put through on goal, but he fired his effort over the bar.

Arsenal continued to control proceedings in the second half, but they were again unable to find a breakthrough until Sanchez's last minute strike.

#  Ozil Signs New 5-year Contract with Arsenal

Arsenal announced Wednesday that Mesut Ozil has signed a new five-year contract with the club.

The 28-year-old playmaker, who joined Arsenal from Real Madrid in 2013, becomes the Gunners' highest-paid player with a reported wage of £350,000 per week.

"It's been four years now and I've loved every minute of it," Ozil said on Arsenal's website. "I'm so happy to be here and to be able to commit my future to this club."

Ozil was entering the final year of his previous contract, and there had been speculation he could leave the Emirates Stadium this summer. But the German is now tied to Arsenal until 2023.

"We are delighted to have secured Mesut's future at Arsenal," said club boss Arsene Wenger. "He is a world-class player and we are very fortunate to have him here."

# Mesut Ozil signs new 5 year contract with Arsenal 

    After much speculation surrounding his future, Mesut Ozil has put pen to paper on a new 5 year contract extension with Premier League side Arsenal. The German playmaker’s last contract was set to expire next summer but he has opted to stay at the Emirates until 2023, making him the highest paid player at the club with a weekly wage of £350,000. 

    Ozil joined Arsenal from Real Madrid in 2013 for a then club record fee of £42.5 million and has since gone on to make 154 appearances for The Gunners, scoring 30 goals in all competitions. The 28 year old played a pivotal role in Arsenal’s FA Cup victory over Chelsea at Wembley last season and is looking forward to more success in North London. “It’s been four years now and I’ve loved every minute of it. I’m so happy to be here and to be able to commit my future to this club” he said on Arsenal’s website. Manager Arsene Wenger praised his star man following the announcement: “We are delighted to have secured Mesut’s future at Arsenal.

#  Arsenal Win 3-1 Against West Ham to Maintain First Place in the Premier League

Arsenal were able to win 3-1 against West Ham United on Saturday thanks to a brace from Pierre Emerick Aubameyang and a goal from Alexandre Lacazette. The Gunners were able to hold onto their first place in the Premier League table and maintain a two-point lead over Manchester City.

Aubameyang scored the opening goal in the eleventh minute of the match after some good play by Aaron Ramsey down the right flank. Ramsey found himself with plenty of space and was able to put in a dangerous cross that Aubameyang was able to head home into the bottom corner of the net.

West Ham equalized just before halftime when Marko Arnautovic was able to score from close range after some good work from Felipe Anderson. However, Arsenal were able to retake the lead just three minutes into the second half when Lacazette was able to score after some good work from Mesut Ozil.

Aubameyang then added his second goal of the match in the seventy-fourth minute when he was played through on goal by Lacazette and was able to slot it past Lukasz Fabianski. This goal proved to be the decisive one as West Ham were unable to pull back another goal despite creating some good chances late on in the match.

This win for Arsenal sees them maintain their lead at the top of the Premier League table and puts them in a strong position heading into the second half of the season.

#  Wenger: We Will Take Europe by Storm

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has declared that his side are ready to take on the best teams in Europe and come out victorious. The Gunners have not had the best of seasons so far and are currently languishing in sixth place in the Premier League, but they remain in contention for silverware in three other competitions.

Wenger insists that his team can still win the Premier League, as they continue their push to close the gap on current leaders Chelsea. They also have a chance to win the FA Cup and Champions League, with their semi-final clash against Atletico Madrid coming up next month.

"There is no complacency in our squad," Wenger said in his pre-match press conference. "We know we can beat any team in Europe and we're going to do everything we can to make sure that happens. We've been knocked out of the Champions League twice in the last four years, so this time we're going all out to make it to the final."

The Frenchman was full of praise for Atletico Madrid, calling them a "very dangerous" opponent, but he believes that Arsenal have what it takes to come out on top. "We've beaten some very good teams already in this competition," he said. "Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Milan - who were all at one point considered among the favourites to win it all - so I see no reason why we can't do it again."

Arsenal's squad has been hit by a number of injuries over the past few months, but Wenger is confident that he has enough quality players available to choose from. "I'm not going to cry about injuries," he said. "We've got plenty of good players here and I'm sure whoever I pick will be more than capable of getting the job done."
